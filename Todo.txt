***Need to fix
-date picker not picking date
-date is not in a format the SQL can user(done)
-change overview to accounts receivable(done)
-change Received to accounts payable(done)
-click save and there is no indication that it saved
-make so that sending an already paid invoice doesn't resend.  
-make it so that dates are pacific not utc

***Libraries
Using date picker library https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday


***Known errors
On viewinvoice.php?invoiceid=
if an invoiceid is passed in get that is not associated with the user an unhandles error occurs.  At least it's better than seeing the wrong clients invoice.
