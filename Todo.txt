***Need to fix
-date picker not picking date
-date is not in a format the SQL can user
-change overview to accounts receivable
-change Received to accounts payable
-click save and there is no indication that it saved

***Libraries
Using date picker library https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday


***Known errors
On viewinvoice.php?invoiceid=
if an invoiceid is passed in get that is not associated with the user an unhandles error occurs.  At least it's better than seeing the wrong clients invoice.
